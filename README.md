# Enhancing-IoV-BERT-IDS-A-Study-on-Hybrid-Intrusion-Detection-Using-BERT-for-Vehicular-Networks
This project reproduces the IoV-BERT-IDS framework to evaluate its performance in vehicular network intrusion detection. Experiments are conducted on public datasets to verify detection accuracy and generalization. Enhancements are proposed to improve model efficiency and adaptability.
